DOTween - Animating from scripts
You could be spending hours upon hours writing your own easing functions in some Update-loop or UniRx Observable - or you could use a tweening library. We recommend using DOTween. It's easy to learn, has a lot of functionality and it's faster than the others! This is extremely handy when you're trying to implement some simple UI animation for example. Do not use this for organic animation, e.g. characters. Refer to Unity's built-in animation system in that case.

Here's a quick example on how to move something to a new position over two seconds with a quint easing, and finally logging to the console:

transform.DOMove(new Vector3(1,2,3), 1).SetEase(Ease.InOutQuint).OnComplete(() =>
{
	Debug.Log("Hello world");
});
